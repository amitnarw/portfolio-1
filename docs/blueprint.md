## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Purple (#BE29EC) to give the sense of boldness and sophistication that many Awwwards sites employ. 
- Background color: Dark gray (#232123) to facilitate readability in a dark scheme.
- Accent color: Cyan (#29ECCC) to create visual interest in secondary design elements, while harmonizing well with the purple due to its close position on the color wheel.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) to achieve a computerized, techy feel that will complement the dark aesthetic.
- Subtle parallax scrolling effects on the background.
- Animated navigation menu with smooth hover effects.
